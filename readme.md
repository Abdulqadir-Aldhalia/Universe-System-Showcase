## What Is Universe?

**Universe** is a secure, scalable, and fully modular academic platform designed for universities and academic institutions of all sizes. It unifies fragmented academic workflows, eliminates the need for insecure third-party tools (such as **Google Classroom**, **WhatsApp**, **Telegram**, **Facebook Groups**, and **Google Forms**), and delivers a resilient, institution-owned ecosystem tailored for modern educational environments.

Originally developed and tested in the Faculty of Information Technology at the **University of Benghazi**, Universe is fully generic and adaptable—ready for deployment at **any academic institution worldwide** with minimal customization.

Built on a **microservices architecture** using **Spring Boot**, **Docker**, **PostgreSQL**, and **RabbitMQ**, Universe provides robust service separation, faculty-level customization, and scalable deployment options through containerization and service discovery.

## Key Features And Capabilities

- **Microservices Architecture**  
  Built using Spring Boot and Docker with a clean separation of concerns and independent deployability.

- **API Gateway**  
  For centralized routing, JWT validation, load balancing, and DNS filtering.

- **Robust Security Infrastructure**  
  - JWT-based authentication with 24h expiration and Redis token revocation  
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
  - PSK-based internal service validation  
  - Post-quantum-aware security planning

- **Offline-First And Resilient**  
  Supports low-connectivity regions and disaster recovery via redundant local data centers.

- **Custom LMS & Public Portal**  
  Fully replaces third-party tools with:  
  1. A Learning Management System  
  2. A Notification Hub  
  3. An External Platform for public users and applicants

- **Service Modules Include:**  
  - `AuthenticationService`  
  - `CourseService`  
  - `GradesService`  
  - `EnrollmentService`  
  - `DepartmentService`  
  - `CollegeService`  
  - `UserProfileService`  
  - `TimeScheduleService`  
  - `EventNewsService`

- **Automated Academic Workflows**  
  Handles GPA calculation, semester transitions, prerequisite checks, waitlisting, and dashboard generation.

- **C4-Modeled System Design**  
  Complete architecture modeled via the C4 model (context, container, component, and class).

- **User-Centric Interfaces**  
  Role-specific dashboards for students, teachers, admins, departments, and public visitors—all built with accessibility (WCAG) and responsiveness in mind.

- **Government-Ready Deployment**  
  Fully compliant with Libya’s **National Education Strategy 2030**, but modular and customizable for global use.

## Who Can Use Universe?

While Universe was initially developed to address academic and sovereignty challenges in Libyan universities, its architecture is **completely generic**. It can be deployed in:

- Public and private universities  
- Colleges and research institutes  
- Vocational and technical education centers  
- Ministries of education or national platforms

With configurable modules, customizable UI/UX, and institution-specific role control, **Universe adapts to your ecosystem**, not the other way around.
